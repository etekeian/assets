It was no accident that she would eventually become head of winemaking, growing up in the vines of the Red Mountain AVA as a young girl with her brother Christophe Hedges, and spending many summers in France with her french born mother, Anne-Marie Hedges. Her skills in the cellar are more naturally focused, as her love of native fermentations and wild yeasts allow her to express authenticity and transparency over facade winemaking."

Concentrating on the terroir of Red Mountain, Hedges Cellars Winery sits in the center of the Red Mountain AVA in Eastern Washington state, classifying the winery as an Estate Grown and Bottled facility. Following the birth of the winery in 1987, Christophe Hedges, son of Tom and Anne-Marie, joined full time in 2001 as Estate Director. Sarah Hedges soon followed in 2006, setting the foundation for Hedges Cellars to transform into Hedges Family Estate."

While the normal processes of wineries is to simply strive for consistency, Hedges Family Estate farms Biodynamically, allowing the year, the place, and the farm all to give the most authentic expression in the wine. One could say that inconsistency is the goal, as no year is ever the same. Biodynamic farming goes beyond the rules of organic farming, its a philosophy that not only uses natural homeopathic aids, but also introduces the use of livestock in creating a balance of farm and place."

The DLD Syrah is an homage to both the Dupont and Liegeois sides of her family. This wine is dedicated to her grand-father Marcel Dupont, Chevalier du Tastevin and bon-vivant, lover of good food and great wines. Grown on a 15 acre vineyard, named Les Gosses, this wine displays the greatest qualities of low yield farming. Earth, fennel spice and structure, the hallmarks of a great Red Mountain syrah, framed by classic French Oak barrels."
