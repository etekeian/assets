After several attempts at different occupations and a few fortune hunts, he fell upon an idea to become a vintner. After hopping in his Rambler and making his way to Napa, where he talked his way into a winery tour guide job, there was no stopping him."

Cartlidge & Browne wines soon began to garner raves from critics and wine lovers alike."
